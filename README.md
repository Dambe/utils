# Title

## Adding git completion for the Shell

## Git scripts source

git-completion.bash is taken from
<https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion>

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
```

## Global git configuration

Create symbolic link to local git.config to use it as global Git configuration:

```bash
ln -s ~/utils/git.config ~/.gitconfig
```

## Show diff output as two windows in vimdiff

To use you can create a symbolic link to `xd` in `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
ln -s ~/src/utils/xd /usr/local/bin/xd
```

Example usage:

```bash
git diff ... |xd
hg diff ... |xd
svn diff ... |xd
cat some.patch |xd
```

You can also preprocess diff output to get more precise results:

```bash
git diff ... |grep -v ... |sed ... |xd
cat some.patch |grep -v ... |sed ... |xd
```
