This HOWTO explains how to get, install and adjust the guilt - the bash utility
to work with patches on the git branches.

Mandatory things
================

Get the sources
---------------

  $ git clone https://github.com/ansv/guilt.git guilt

This is the extended version of the original git://repo.or.cz/guilt.git


Install
-------

  $ make install


Optional things
===============

Install documentation if needed
-------------------------------

  $ make install-doc


Be much faster
==============

If you like the typing or you type ultimative fast and never do the typos by
this and if you like to drive with the closed eyes, then just ignore the rest
of this manual.

All the following additions must be done in your .bashrc/.zshrc.


Use short alias instead of guilt
--------------------------------

Use 'q' instead of 'guilt':

  alias q=guilt


Add autocompletion
------------------

Add the following line (I assume git-prompt.sh is located in ~/utils/)

  source ~/utils/guilt-completion.bash

This also works for 'q'.


Show patch-queue state
----------------------

To show the status of the current guilt patch-queue add the following function:

  qq() {
    local APPNUM=$(guilt app |wc -l)
    guilt unapplied |tac
    echo
    git status -s -uno
    echo
    git log -$APPNUM --oneline
    echo
    git log -1 HEAD~$APPNUM --oneline --decorate
  }

The command 'qq' shows the unapplied patches, then changed files (that are not
in the patches) if any, then the applied patches as a oneline git log and
finally the base for the patch queue.
